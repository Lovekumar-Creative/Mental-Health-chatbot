# 🧠  Mental Health Chatbot

Mental health chatbot is an AI-powered Mental Health Chatbot built using **FastAPI**, **BERT**, and **Ollama LLM**.  
The chatbot first classifies the user's mental health condition using a fine-tuned BERT model and then generates supportive and empathetic responses using a local Large Language Model (LLM).

# ⚙️ How It Works

## Step 1: User sends a message

Example:

```text
I feel stressed and anxious all the time
```

---

## Step 2: BERT Model Classification

The BERT model predicts the mental health category.

Example:

```text
Anxiety
```

The classification logic is implemented in:

```python
predict_text(text)
```

using:
- BertTokenizer
- BertForSequenceClassification

---

## Step 3: LLM Response Generation

The predicted class and user query are passed to Ollama LLM.

The chatbot:
- Gives supportive responses
- Avoids harmful advice
- Refuses unrelated topics
- Encourages professional help for suicidal intent

Implemented in:

```python
generate_response(user_query, predicted_class)
```

using:
- Ollama
- TinyLlama

## Step 4: FastAPI Returns Response

FastAPI handles API requests and returns the chatbot response.

Available endpoints:

### GET `/`

Checks if API is running.

### POST `/chat`

Send user message and receive AI response.

Implemented in:

```python
@app.post("/chat")
```
